  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    A dish that requires simple steps, but is seemingly complicated. To some people, it comes naturally whilst for some others it’s a journey to master just the basics. However, I say it’s a journey that is worth it all! A delicious dish that encompasses: Blitz, fry, simmer, and steam, no more, no less. This recipe will guide even the novice of novices to embark on this delicious journey. One of the many Jollof rice variations that I promise you will enjoy.

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Chop the tomatoes, onions, and bell pepper into chunks. Place into a blender/food processor together with the ginger, garlic, and scotch bonnet pepper. Then blitz into a smooth paste.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Place a pot over medium heat, pour in the sunflower oil, and add the blended mixture. Stir and allow to sizzle, then place a lid over it, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      After simmering for 20 minutes, remove the lid, then add the spices and seasonings (Paprika, thyme, nutmeg, bay leaf, and salt). Stir altogether.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Also pour in the rice and vegetable or meat stock and stir together.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Place a piece of aluminium foil into the pot, covering the entire surface of the rice (this will keep the steam in), then place a lid over the pot. Cook for 20 minutes on low heat (Stirring occasionally to cook the rice evenly and also to prevent it from burning at the bottom).
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Remove lid, bin the aluminium foil and give the rice a gentle stir, then return the lid and cook for another 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Now the rice should be ready to serve. Serve hot with your favourite sides and enjoy!
