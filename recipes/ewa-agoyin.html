  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <h3>For the Ewa Agoyin</h3>
    <li>
      Pick out the specks of dirt from the beans, rinse and drain the beans a couple of times.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Pour the beans in a stockpot, add the water and cook till it becomes very tender – about 2 to 2½ hours.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Use a Potato Masher or a wooden spoon to mash the Beans to your preference.
    </li>

    <h3>For the Ewa Agoyin Stew</h3>
    <li>
      Rehydrate the dried Chilies and bell peppers by soaking them in water overnight or pour hot boiling water over them for about 2 hours.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Blend the rehydrated Peppers with the onions, ginger, and about a quarter cup of water and set aside.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Preheat the Palm oil in a pan on medium heat until the oil is very hot but not bleached.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Add the sliced onion and let it cook for about 10 to 15 minutes. We want it browned and not black or burnt.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Stir in the blended peppers and cook for about 10 minutes
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Add the seasoning cubes, crayfish, and salt to taste.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Leave it to cook for another 5 to 10 minutes; by this time, the color of the pepper would have changed from bright red to dark red. If not, cook for some additional time.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Serve the Sauce over the Ewa Agoyin (Ewa Aganyin) or eat with your Agege Bread and Enjoy!
